Nice to add
	* Hangfire jobs. Was thinking it might be nice to put deleted ToDos on a 30 day timer for actual deletion. Hangfire will delete these after 30 days
* Fitlers and sorting?
* Remove unused endpoints such as /auth
* Setup logging
* Maybe come back and create a UpdateEntity class
* ToDo: DatabaseContext.ConfigureConventions seems like a good spot to put my custom model building logic
* Leverage SortOrder so that user can drag and drop todo items
* Add support for recurring ToDos
