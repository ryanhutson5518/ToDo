* Remove unused endpoints such as /auth
* I feel like adding a table to track ToDo priorities might be nice
* At the very end, I can maybe just delete the migrations folder and have 1 migration. Might be confusing though not sure
* Maybe come back and create a UpdateEntity class. Use in ToDoForm
* LEFT OFF => Continue configuring the custom model creating functionality
* ToDo: DatabaseContext.ConfigureConventions seems like a good spot to put my custom model building logic
